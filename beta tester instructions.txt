So, here is what I need you to do to test: Read the instructions. They have changed since the last release. See if they are easy to understand. If you find any mistakes write them in a text file and give me enough info so I can locate the error and fix it. If something is not clear note that in the text file and briefly explain the confusing part.

Then after that, test the functionality. First, make a copy of your shrad and test it on the copy. I don't want to mess up your files.

After you have tested it on a good known server with all of the config files I will need you to do a couple of weird things.

First, remove the following files:
in the POL root folder delete or move pol.cfg. In the POL config folder move or delete combat.cfg, servers.cfg, servspecopt.cfg, watch.cfg . In /scripts move or delete ecompile.cfg and last find your uoclient.cfg file and move or delete that.

Then run the Configurator and see if it tells you that those files are missing. If it does, let it replace them with the default files. For extra credit you can go back and delete them one at a time and test that but I don't think that is necessary as there is a single procedure that checks for all the
Remember to check the paths on the eCompile and Server Settings pages to make sure the paths point to the "absolute" directories. In otherwords, c:\pol\scripts or whatevet, not just \scripts.
I think I still need to fix that.
